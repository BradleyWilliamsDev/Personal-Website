            I am a Game Designer, developer, and software engineer. During my
            studies I focused on the development side of making games. During my
            3 years of study I received 2 awards one for the best project
            throughout the entire university, and the second award was for the
            best game created. To conclude my studies I was required to do work
            for a company. I ended up doing mine at the software development
            firm BBD. I was only required to be there for a week but ended up
            being asked to stay for longer and the time I ended up being there
            was 3 months.

                    <p>I have worked on creating custom software for companies allowing for their processes to run smoother and more efficiently. My roles were to design and implement the UI.<br/></p>
                    <p>Techstack: <br>
                    -Unity<br>
                    -C#<br>
                    -Blender</p>

                    <p>Problems solved:</p>
                    <p>-While working at the company I created character movement systems for 3d software for companies to allow the client to move around the world and explore the world for the software. <br> <br>

                    -I have designed worlds for the character controller to move around in in conjunction with the software that the client requested. <br> <br>

                    -Fixed texturing issues when a system that auto applied textures would apply broken textures. <br> <br>

                    -Created an oct-tree system that would split geometry in the world to allow for culling to occur to allow for the program to run smoother and have higher fps. <br> <br>

                    -Fixed small bugs in code.</p>

                  <p>BBD is a software development company that specializes in custom software for
companies, they create any software a company may need from banks to small
                  businesses.</p>
                  <p>-Started with the task of creating 2 websites in a short amount of time allowing me to display my abilities to adapt and work under pressure. <br>
                  -Worked with a team to develop and fix bugs with the company's internal tool. <br>
                  -Reviewed other employees' code to make sure it was efficient and followed the company's formatting guidelines.
                  </p>

                  <p>Tech stack used: <br>

                  <p>Problems Solved: <br>
                  -While working at the internship I was tasked with creating a delete function for an internal tool for the company, the delete function would work with the database and make sure it would delete the data from the database. After the functionality was completed I was tasked with designing the pop-up menu that would show when someone requested to delete data, also prompting them to type out a given sentence to ensure that the user was sure they wanted to delete data to prevent data that wasn't supposed to be deleted from being lost.</p>
